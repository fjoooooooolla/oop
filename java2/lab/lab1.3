name (array of characters not longer than 20 characters)
surname (array of characters not longer than 20 characters)
jersey number (integer)
points on first match (integer)
points on second match (integer)

Write the needed methods for the class, and write a method for printing details about the basketball player in the following format "Player: name surname with number: number has avg_pts points on average".
The program should receive the name, surname, jersey number and points from 3 matches on standard input.

On standard output just print out the details about the basketball player using the created method.
